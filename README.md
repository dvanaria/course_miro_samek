# embedded_programming_course
This is a 34-part YouTube course by Dr. Miro Samek, covering embedded programming on ARM Cortext-M based microcontrollers.

Each "episode" contains a project file that encapsulates all the project files for the IDE used in the course: an application called The Embedded Workbench for ARM (by a company called IAR Systems). The popular abbreviation for this IDE is "EWARM".

What I'm keeping in this particular repository are my own project files and source code, which often dive a little deeper into each concept and go off on my own experiments/ideas after each course episode is finished. 

Each episode covers a different aspect of embedded programming. It uses a development board from Texas Instruments called the "Tiva C Series LaunchPad" (though the name of this development board, and the microcontroller it contains, is slightly different in the video series - I'm just using a more recent dev board than Dr. Samek uses. Both dev boards are based on the same TM4C123G microcontroller.)

This course is a wonderful resource. It moves very quickly and leaves the viewer to figure out a lot of things on their own, through experimentation and digging in deeper on certain topics. I believe this is the optimal way to learn something, at least for myself.
